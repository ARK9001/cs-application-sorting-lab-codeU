## learning goals
Student can use the PriorityQueue class to find the top-10 elements in a stream of results.  They understand the heap implementation of PriorityQueue.

## notes
Choosing which urls to sort. Grabbing the top 10 urls using a priority queue. Naive is to read the whole thing, then make a prioriy queue to just keep the top 10. Use the built in Pri Queue, then explain the heap implmentation
